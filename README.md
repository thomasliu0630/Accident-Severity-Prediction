With millions of traffic accidents across the U.S., we analyzed key factors contributing to accident severity using the US Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset from Kaggle. Our approach includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine
learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting. This project aims to prioritize severe accidents, educate the public on high-risk conditions, and suggest safety measures.
